# Gold Price Prediction App

This project is a **machine learning web application** built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) that predicts the gold price based on several financial indicators. It uses a pre-trained model to provide predictions from user input.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Interactive web interface for gold price prediction  
- Accepts **SPX (Gold Ratio)**, **GLD (Gold Share)**, **USO (Crude Oil Share)**, and **SLV (Silver Share)** as inputs  
- Uses a **pre-trained machine learning model** for instant predictions  
- Built with **Streamlit** for simplicity and ease of deployment  

## ðŸ“Š Model Training

The Jupyter Notebook `Gold_Price_Prediction.ipynb` contains the data preprocessing, feature selection, and training steps for the predictive model. You can retrain the model by running the notebook and saving the new `.sav` file.
